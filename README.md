# NYU's Data Science Bootcamp Project: Movie Recommendation System
## Popcorn Predictors

### Intro
Recommendation systems have become an integral part of how we discover and enjoy content, from movies and music to products and services. They help personalize the user experience by suggesting items that match individual preferences. A movie recommendation system, for example, identifies patterns in what people watch and uses that information to suggest films theyâ€™re likely to enjoy.
 
### Problem Statement:

The goal is to design and implement a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and the attributes of movies. This project focuses on exploring different recommendation approaches, including demographic filtering, content-based filtering, and collaborative filtering, to create a robust and effective recommendation engine.
